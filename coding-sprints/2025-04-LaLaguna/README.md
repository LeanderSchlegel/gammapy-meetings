# Gammapy Coding Sprint, April 2025

* Start: Monday, April 7th, 2025 
* End: Friday, April 11th, 2025
* Location: IAC (La Laguna, Spain)
* Contacts: [facero](https://github.com/facero)

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **are interested to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop on how to use Gammapy.

Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Zoom.

The usual Zoom room of the dev calls will be open the full week.

## Local Logistics

The meeting will take place at IAC (Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias) is located in the island of Tenerife [Gmap link](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T1GSm5owLfRmhF17A) in the city of La Laguna.

You can arrive either at Tenerife North airport (TFN) or South (TFS).  TFN is 15mn away from La Laguna and TFS is ~1h by bus. 
However TFN only has national flights (Madrid, Barcelona, etc) so no direct flights from outside Spain. TFS has direct flights from most European capitals via low cost companies like EasyJet, Vueling, Transavia, Ryanair, etc

Good to know: in case you plan and extra weekend to visit LaPalma and the CTAO-Northern site  you can imagine landing at Tenerife and going back home from LaPalma (LaPalma -> Madrid/BCN -> Home).  
A one-way ticket from TFN -> LaPalma costs ~70-100e for a 30mn flight (a bit expensive) so book early.


Hotels : I would recommend to look for hotels in the city of La Laguna which is a world heritage [UNESCO](https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/929/gallery/) site and walkable distance to the IAC (15-20mn) or 10mn via Tram.
