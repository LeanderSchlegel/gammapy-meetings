A# Gammapy CodiOAng Sprint, May 2024

* Start: Monday, May 27th, 2024 at 2 pm
* End: Friday, May 31th, 2024 at noon
* Location: MPIK (Heidelberg, Germany)
* Contacts: [QRemy](https://github.com/QRemy), [registerrier](https://https://github.com/github.com/registerrier)

This meeting is a "coding sprint" for people that **want to work on the development** of Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org/). You're very welcome if you're new to coding or haven't contributed to
Gammapy yet. But note that this is **not** a workshop on how to use Gammapy.

Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Zoom.

The usual Zoom room of the dev calls will be open the full week.
